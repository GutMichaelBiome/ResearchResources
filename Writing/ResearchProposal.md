## Proposal Outline

This is an example research proposal outline. The scope is quite large, so adjust as needed to suit your needs.

### SIGNIFICANCE 
* What is the problem? 
* Why is the problem important?
* What do we know about the state of the problem? 
* What don't we know about the state of the problem? 
* How does addressing this knowledge gap transform the nature/understanding/solution to the problem?

### Background to the problem
* Define the problem
    * What do we know about the problem (as it relates to the proposal)
    * What don't we know about the problem (as it relates to the proposal)
* Rationale for the work
    * Why is focusing on this problem useful/important
    * Why is focusing on our specific focal area of the problem useful/important
* Impact of the work
    * What is leaned/advanced as a result of addressing our focal area of the work

### INNOVATION

* Why is this the time to do the work? 
* What new technologies/concepts/approaches allow us to address the problem in a new light? 
* How does addressing the problem this way transform solutions?

* Summarize why this is the time to address this problem and why your strategy/approach will reveal new insight
    * List all of the innovation aspects of the proposal:
        * Practical (Methods, analyses, technology)
        * Conceptual (theories)

### APPROACH
* How will you successfully address or advance knowledge/understanding about the problem?

Introduction to the Aims
* Describe the team and their credibility for doing the work
* Provide rationale for the approach (though it could go into each aim explicitly, or in the Background section above)
    * Preliminary data
* Rationale for the work: State your overall hypothesis and WHY this hypothesis has merit
* State the overall outcomes of the work


#### Aim 1
* Rationale for the Aim. Why are you focusing on this aim
* Expectations. 
    * State briefly what you intend to do
    * Why you intend to do it
    * What you expect to learn as a result
* Technical approach. 
    * Multiple subsections for the various techniques you will apply
        * Define briefly how the technique works
        * How you will implement
        * What you will observe/learn as a result
* Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
* Outcomes

#### Aim 2
* Rationale for the Aim. Why are you focusing on this aim
* Expectations. 
    * State briefly what you intend to do
    * Why you intend to do it
    * What you expect to learn as a result
* Technical approach. 
    * Multiple subsections for the various techniques you will apply
        * Define briefly how the technique works
        * How you will implement
        * What you will observe/learn as a result
* Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
* Outcomes

#### Aim 3
* Rationale for the Aim. Why are you focusing on this aim
* Expectations. 
    * State briefly what you intend to do
    * Why you intend to do it
    * What you expect to learn as a result
* Technical approach. 
    * Multiple subsections for the various techniques you will apply
        * Define briefly how the technique works
        * How you will implement
        * What you will observe/learn as a result
* Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
* Outcomes

### Timeline & Budget



## Outline Example:

Follow this general format for introducing a major idea.

1. Major idea
   1. Topic sentence #1
      * Specific argument and support
      * Specific argument and support
      * Specific argument and support
 
   2. Topic sentence #2
      * Specific argument and support
      * Specific argument and support
      * Specific argument and support

   3. Topic sentence #3    
      * Specific argument and support
      * Specific argument and support
      * Specific argument and support
